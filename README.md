### Tools

Minimal set of dev tools that I've configured for practicality in mind. All of what I want, none of what I don't.

#### Alacritty
* Bare config. Just works. Most importantly to this workflow however: can use across all three major operating systems.

#### Neovim
* Lazy.nvim for package management
* Indentation guides
* Telescope for fuzzy finding through files/commits/whatever
* LSP and autocomplete/snippets

Ready to quickly drop into any environment I'm working in.
